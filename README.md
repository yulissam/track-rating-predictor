# track-rating-predictor

Our group decided to use Harvard's [Semantic computing of moods based on tags in social media of music dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TVYEGI) on 600 different songs published on Spotify that were rated on their "mood tags" from listeners. These mood tags are atmospheric, sad, arousal, sensual, tension, dark, valence, happy, and sentimental.

This project aims to build a model that could predict the rating of at least one mood, in this project we had arbitrarily chose sentimental. Through feature selection, binning of the data, and/or encoding features we sought to use Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Clustering algorithms to analyze our data and make a prediction on what the rating would be for Sentimental, mimicking users' rating of the mood elicited by the song.
